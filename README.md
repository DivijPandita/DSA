# Library Management System

## Introduction
This is a **Library Management System** developed using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It utilizes fundamental data structures such as **Binary Tree, Linked List, and Queue** to efficiently manage book records, users, and transactions.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and search for books using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.
- **User Management**: Maintain user records with a **Linked List**.
- **Borrow & Return System**: Handle book checkouts and returns using a **Queue**.
- **Efficient Searching**: Quickly locate books and users in the system.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load book and user records.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++/Python/Java *(Mention your language)*
- **Data Structures Used**: Binary Tree, Linked List, Queue
- **File Handling** (if applicable)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd library-management-system
   ```
3. Compile and run the program *(for C++ example)*:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o library
   ./library
   ```
   *(Modify based on your programming language)*

## Usage
- Run the program and follow the menu-driven interface.
- Add new books and users.
- Borrow and return books.
- Search for books and users.

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced search and sorting
- Web-based interface
- User authentication system
- Data visualization for library statistics
